## System tests

System tests run a sample EDC connector with the Identity Hub extension and a DID server with sample DID documents for the connector and an external authority using docker. The test checks the correct functioning of the Identity Hub CLI and CredentialsVerifier.

#### Local test resources

Following test resources are provided in order to run system tests:

- A set of Private and Public keys for both the external authority and the EDC connector (identity hub owner) e.g. `system-tests/resources/jwt/authority`.

    ```bash
    # generate a private key
    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private-key.pem
    # generate corresponding public key
    openssl ec -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem
    ```
- Web DIDs are available under `system-tests/resources/webdid` folder. The `publicKeyJwk` section of each `did.json` was generated by converting the corresponding public key to JWK format, for example the authority public key was converted to JWK using following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -i danedmunds/pem-to-jwk:1.2.1 --public --pretty < system-tests/tests/resources/jwt/identity-hub-owner/public-key.pem
    ```
